Decomposition of particulate backscatter signal into small and large particles

Code for decomposing particulate backscatter signal into large and small particle components following the methods of (Briggs et al., 2020) and a modified version used in (Park et al., in prep).

Data used here in this example is from a B-profile downloaded from the Argo GDAC (Argo, 2000) and quality-controlled using the [EuroArgo BBP RTQC](https://github.com/euroargodev/BBP_RTQC). The methods for QC are outlined in (Dall'Olmo et al., 2022).
